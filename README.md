Wi-Fi Locationing
================

Abstract
--------

Unlike outdoor positioning, which uses GPS satellites, indoor locationing with a cell phone is a challenge due to poor or no access to satellite signals. An active area of research to address this problem utilizes signals from Wireless Access Points (WAPs) in a building. The approach covered in this project known as fingerprinting, uses a training set of locations in a building and the corresponding signal strength from all detected WAPs. In this way, a 'fingerprint' of WAP signal strength is produced for each position in a building. One challenge to this approach is that the received signal strength can vary based on the phone brand and model, and the position of the phone (i.e. the height of phone owner).

The goal of this project was to determine if a classification model can be built to identify a location in a building down to a level of granularity that would be useful. Namely, the model should be able to identify the location of the entrance to a room/space.

Methods
-------

The data set for this analysis is publicly available at the [UCI Machine Learning repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/UJIIndoorLoc). The data was generated at a 3-building complex at Universitat Jaume I in Spain that covers ~110,000 m<sup>2</sup>. The data consists of 19,937 instances and 529 features. The first 520 features contain the received signal strength indicator value (RSSI) of wireless access points (WAPs) for an instance at a location. The remaining features contain additional location information along with user and phone information. The description of the features is summarized below.

One of the first orders of business was to devise an approach to creating a unique location ID that will become our categorical dependent variable. Again, with the goal of determining if a model could be built that would predict building location down to a useful granularity, the features Floor, BuildingID, SpaceID, and RelativePosition == 2 were grouped to create a unique location ID.

Another issue to address was what to do with the RSSI values where no signal was received. The number of WAPs received ranges from 0-51 so each Wi-Fi fingerprint contains &gt;469 null values. The RSSI values range from -104-0 dBm with 0 being the strongest signal. The original data set uses a value of +100 dBm to code for the absence of signal. However, it was decided that the value of -110 dBm would be used instead as that value is weaker than any in the data set.

A kNN, decision tree (C5.0), and a Random Forest classifier were built and the cross-validated performance was compared. The Random Forest classifier outperformed the other models with a CV accuracy of 86%.

Almost 75% of the instances created by this phone were misclassified by the Random Forest model. Removal of instances related to this phone and retraining a Random Forest model resulted in a CV accuracy of 89%.
